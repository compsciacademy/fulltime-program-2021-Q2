# Day 07

Let's take a look back at our Shopping List application, and dive into the world of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete), as this is often said to be one of the most common sets of operations to perform on data.

We'll split our application, this time into 3 parts:

User Interface (CLI)
Application Layer (internal logic)
Data Store (file)

## Exercise 01

We have added some code to the `./ShoppingList` directory that satisfies the requirements for our CRUD application. That is, we are able to Create, Read, Update, and Delete a Shopping List.

Have a look at the code, and look for ways that it could be refactored (better organized/cleaned up/re-written to be _better_ in some manner).

```rb
# code goes here

```
