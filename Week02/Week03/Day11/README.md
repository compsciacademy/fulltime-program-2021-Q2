# Day 11

Think through the game we have been working on, and make a list of _features_ that can act as vertical slices. That is, stand alone features that can be implemented and tested without relying on other features to be implemented.  
  
It's possible that some features will build on others, and/or that some sets of features will require others to have been implemented. For example, a player must exist for a player to obtain a cat.  
  
## Exercise 01  
  
Create a list of features that the game should support.  
  
When someone starts the game, they are prompted to find or create their player character.

  * start game
    * find or create Player
        * get a cat
