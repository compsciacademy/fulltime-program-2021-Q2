# Day 17  
  
We left off with a homework assignment that was intended to challenge us to think through how we might save Orders and Order Items, without the complexity of the rest of the system.  
  
```ruby
# Exercise 02 a.) Bonus I
# Write methods on the Order and OrderItem classes
# that will return the last saved item of each.  

order = Order.last
order_item = OrderItem.last
```   
   
**HOMEWORK**: Check out the [`bonus.rb`](https://github.com/compsciacademy/fulltime-program-2021-Q2/blob/main/Week04/Day16/Exercise02/Bonus_I/bonus.rb#L43) for details.  
  
Good luck & Have fun!

Let's open up a working file and satisfy the requirements for the homework. That is, "Write methods on the Order and OrderItem classes that will return the last saved item of each."
