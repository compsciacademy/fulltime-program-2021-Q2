# Day 16  
  
Last time, we talked about extending our Project Management Application into a more fully-featured system. That included adding some concepts like Materials and Orders. There may be more to it that just those things, but let's see if we can [revisit the exercise](https://github.com/compsciacademy/fulltime-program-2021-Q2/tree/main/Week03/Day15#day-15), and walk through what may be required to make it happen.  
  

c.) Back to the Project Management Application...

In addition to the above, projects have materials that are required for work to be done. Materials are ordered, and orders have delivery dates, prices, etc. really, all the things you'd expect an order to have.

Think through what type of functionality will need to be added to your application to support Project Material Order status, costs, delays, etc.

We will also want to (eventually) perform queries such as, "How much money was wasted on waiting for project material orders to be delivered?" (this is not in actual query syntax)
