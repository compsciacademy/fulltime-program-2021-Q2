# Day 56  
  
Final Project  
-------------   
  
You have a chance to work on your own portfolio app. If you have something in mind that you'd prefer to work on, that highlights a majority of the things we've covered, then feel free to do so, otherwise, have a look at the following suggestion.  
  
Write an application where people can sign up for an account, build out a profile page for themselves, with a profile photo, post either in the short-feed posts (small messages, up to 256 characters) or in the long-form post style (like a blog post).  
  
Users should be able to like and/or upvote and/or downvote posts from other users. There should also be the ability to friend and/or follow users.  
  
Users should receive email notifications when a post of theirs is liked.  

**BONUS** (Stretch Goals):  
  
Try to think through the situations where it makes sense to send email notifications, e.g. should we send email for every time a post is liked, a person if followed or a friend-request is sent, etc.?  
  * Allow users to have settings where they decide how often to receive which updates.  
  * Show a history of profile pictures.
  * Allow for photo albums
  * Add syntax highlighting for code snippets in both long and short form posts
  * Tags -- polymorphic
  * Scheduled events
    - sends messages to followers
    - filter events by tags/interests
    - etc.
  * etc.
