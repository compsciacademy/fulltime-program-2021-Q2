## Quiz Time!  
  
**Option A**  

Create an application that allows you to create TODO lists. The index view should show a list of TODO lists, maybe with a maximum of 10 lists shown at a time (you can use pagination).  

Showing a list should give the option to add an item, remove an item, mark an item as done (unmark an item as being done).  
  
**Option B**  
  
Create an application that allows you to create a list of your favorite links. Each link should have a title, and a description. You should also be able to upvote and downvote links.  
  
The index view should allow you to see all the lists, maybe with a maximum of 5 or 10 at a time (you can use pagination). It would be great to also have the ability to see the top 3 upvoted links.
