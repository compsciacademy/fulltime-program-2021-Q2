# Getting Starting

Markdown is a very useful tool for formatting documentation. Many README files are written using markdown.

Here is a link to a [markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

Today, we are going to be having a look at some of the tooling, such as markdown and git, that we will be using on the course, and of course, at Ruby!

## Useful CLI Commands

```
pwd    prints the working directory
ls     lists files and directories within a directory
touch  creates a file if it doesn't exist otherwise updates its timestamp
mkdir  creates a directory
mv     moves a file or directory
cp     copies a file or directory and its contents
rm     removes a file or directory
cd     change directory
cat    concatenates files (also prints them to the terminal)
echo   print to standard out
```

**Exercise 01**

Using the CLI commands we have just gone over, do the following:

  * Create 2 new directories: dir_a, dir_b
  * Create 1 new directory inside dir_b: dir_c
  * Create 3 new files: a.txt, b.txt, c.txt
  * Move file a.txt and b.txt into dir_a
  * Move file c.txt into dir_c
  * Copy files a.txt, b.txt into dir_b
